    ``busy_timeout_ms`` is the single busy knob: it is passed as ``connect(timeout=)`` AND set as the
    explicit PRAGMA so it is observable. ``wal=True`` goes through ``apply_wal_with_fallback`` — the
    only journal-mode setter that carries the WAL-reset-bug gate, the network-FS silent-refusal
    fallback and the never-live-downgrade invariant; a raw ``PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`` bypasses all
    three. Only the transient ``database is locked`` from that pragma is retried (``wal_lock_retries``):
    a first opener initializing a shared DB can make it ignore the busy timeout, notably on Windows.
