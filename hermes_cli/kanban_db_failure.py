    running with an open run — restore source phase or ``blocked``, release
    claim, close run). Both False: timeout/crash path (caller already restored
    the phase and closed the run; only the counter moves, a trip flips to

    ``failure_limit`` > ``DEFAULT_FAILURE_LIMIT``. ``force_trip`` trips
    unconditionally (caller applied its own bounded-retry policy).

    with ``infrastructure: true`` but ``consecutive_failures`` is left alone and
